\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

In this course, students will use a combination of prerecorded lectures,
tutorial sessions, group presentations, short quizzes, and an
interactive simulation to cover topics in international law (IL)
distributed across four modules:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is international law and where is it found?
\item
  Actors in international law: who takes part?
\item
  When does international law apply?
\item
  How is international law applied?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

This one-semester course is intended to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  introduce the fundamentals of IL and its relationship with domestic
  law;
\item
  improve your understanding of the role of IL and international
  organizations;
\item
  familiarize you with the legal principles governing the creation,
  rights, and duties of subjects of IL;
\item
  help you analyze the interplay of legal customs and norms which govern
  diplomacy and treaties;
\item
  examine circumstances where law is absent or deficient in maintaining
  stability and peaceful interactions; and
\item
  discuss whether IL has been beneficial to the human and global
  environment.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{grades}{%
\section{Grades}\label{grades}}

\hypertarget{composition}{%
\subsection{Composition}\label{composition}}

Your final course grade is a combination of scores according to the
table shown below. Additional explanations for each component can be
found on the \emph{Assignments} tab on Canvas.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsubsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

Each module has a short, timed quiz which must be completed before
beggining the subsequent modules. Quizzes are open-book. The course quiz
with the lowest grade is automatically dropped.

\hypertarget{group-presentations}{%
\subsubsection{Group Presentations}\label{group-presentations}}

There are two group presentations, with dates assigned within the second
week of the semester. Instructions for the presentations are the same,
except for subject of the research for each. Each group must obtain
approval for the presentation topic(s) at least one week before the
presentation. Each class group must present on:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  An topic of significance to contemporary international legal and
  political discourse, which may implicate multiple legal cases and
  affects the couuntry to which the student was assigned
  (\textbf{Contemporary Issue Presentation}); and
\item
  A single case mentioned in the course required readings or lecture
  slides (\textbf{Case Law Presentation}), not to include any case
  presented on in \#1 of this same list.
\end{enumerate}

The group grade awarded by the professor will be assigned with varying
weight to each group member. Weights are based on the anonymous
evaluations provided by the other members of the group. The final grade
awarded to group members will differ if their contributions are
evaluated differently.

\hypertarget{reading-guides}{%
\subsubsection{Reading Guides}\label{reading-guides}}

A set of graded questions is provided for each week's readings to steer
students towards the more important parts of the readings. Completed
reading guides serve as helpful study guides for the course quizzes and
help to identify areas towards which a student might need to focus more
research attention.

\hypertarget{discussion-grades}{%
\subsubsection{Discussion Grades}\label{discussion-grades}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each student will be assigned a list of questions, from which (s)he
  will choose one to answer in an initial \textbf{Discussion Post} to
  the discussion board. The Discussion Post should consist of a minimum
  of 300 words.
\item
  With a total of two (2) \textbf{Discussion Responses}, a student will
  respond to a discussion post offered by two (2) other students with at
  least 100 words.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\subsubsection{Final Project}\label{final-project}}

The Final Project will comprise the last two weeks of the semester. For
the project, students will be presented with a hypothetical political
scenario.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In \textbf{Part 1}, as a group, students submit a reference guide,
  along with peer evaluations of group members' contribution. The
  reference guide makes note of every legal topic/concept and case
  covered in the course implicated in the hypothetical scenario.
\item
  In \textbf{Part 2}, students submit indiviual, short essay responses
  to a set of questions.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{scales}{%
\subsection{Scales}\label{scales}}

This course uses the grading scale displayed here. Due dates are rare,
but when they do exist, they should be adhered to. Assignments will
receive a deduction of 5 percent for each day they are late (i.e.,
SMTWRFA). Students are expected to complete missing assignments before
seeking any extra credit (offered to the entire class). Extra credit
will not be assigned within the last two weeks of the semester.

  sessions.
\item
  Students should contribute equally to group work and identify
  classmates who do not.

  kind.\footnote{Here, a reasonable argument must present at least one
    statement for and one against your chosen point of view.}

\hypertarget{rules-for-on-line-interaction}{%
\subsection{Rules for On-line
Interaction}\label{rules-for-on-line-interaction}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You should be fully dressed as if you were physically attending a
  university class.
\item
  Caring for dependents is \textbf{not} considered distracting. Should
  the need arise, you are allowed to have people or pets \textbf{quietly
  sit} with you during video-enabled Zoom meetings.
\item
  Keep microphones on mute, unless you are answering or offering a
  question.
\item
  Please use the nonverbal features available to you on Zoom, where
  possible.
\item
  You may also silently use gestures you would normally use in a
  physical classroom environment, such as raising your hand.
\item
  \textbf{Remember: sarcasm is fine; joke within reason; and sexual
  harassment is a thing. Our on-line communications might not be
  conveyed as positively as our in-class interactions might.}

Policy}\label{university-attendance-policy}}

I do not take attendance in this course. Excused absences include
documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises,
call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and
official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a
way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid excuse.
Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children
experience serious illness.

\hypertarget{academic-honor-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic Honor Policy}\label{academic-honor-policy}}

The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the
University's expectations for the integrity of students' academic work,
the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations,
and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members
throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the
Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to ``\ldots be
honest and truthful and\ldots{} {[}to{]} strive for personal and
institutional integrity at Florida State University.'' (For more details

violationsLinks to an external site..)

Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should (1)

need for accommodation and what type. Please note that instructors are
not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until
appropriate verification from the Student Disability Resource Center has
been provided. This syllabus and other class materials are available in
