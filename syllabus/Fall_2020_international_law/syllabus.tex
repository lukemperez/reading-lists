\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

In this course, students will use a combination of prerecorded lectures,
discussion boards, group presentations, short quizzes, and a group
project to cover topics in international law (IL) distributed across six
modules which collectively answer four questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is international law and where is it found?
\item
  Actors in international law: who takes part?
\item
  When does international law apply?
\item
  How is international law applied?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

This one-semester course is intended to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  introduce the fundamentals of IL and its relationship with domestic
  law;
\item
  improve your understanding of the role of IL and international
  organizations;
\item
  familiarize you with the legal principles governing the creation,
  rights, and duties of subjects of IL;
\item
  help you analyze the interplay of legal customs and norms which govern
  diplomacy and treaties;
\item
  examine circumstances where law is absent or deficient in maintaining
  stability and peaceful interactions; and
\item
  discuss whether IL has been beneficial to the human and global
  environment.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{required-textbook}{%

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\section{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

This class is taught asynchronously, meaning that we will not all meet
regularly at any point in the semester. Please be aware, however, that
group projects require coordination within smaller groups to meet within
the course Zoom meeting room for recording presentations. Zoom meeting
rooms may also be used by these smaller groups for planning for either
the group presentations or the Final Project: Part 1.

\hypertarget{grades}{%
\section{Grades}\label{grades}}

\hypertarget{composition}{%
\subsection{Composition}\label{composition}}

Your final course grade is a combination of scores according to the
table shown below. Additional explanations for each component can be
found on the \emph{Assignments} tab on Canvas.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsubsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

Each of the six (6) course modules has a short, timed quiz which must be
completed by the due date indicated. Quizzes are open-book. The course
quiz with the lowest grade is automatically dropped.

\hypertarget{group-presentations}{%
\subsubsection{Group Presentations}\label{group-presentations}}

There are two group presentations, with dates assigned within the second
week of the semester. Instructions for the presentations are the same,
except for subject of the research for each. Each group must obtain
approval for the presentation topic(s) at least one week before the
presentation. Each class group must present on:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  An topic of significance to contemporary international legal and
  political discourse, which may implicate multiple legal cases and
  affects the couuntry to which the student was assigned
  (\textbf{Contemporary Issue Presentation}); and
\item
  A single case mentioned in the course required readings or lecture
  slides (\textbf{Case Law Presentation}), not to include any case
  presented on in \#1 of this same list.
\end{enumerate}

The group grade awarded by the professor will be assigned with varying
weight to each group member. Weights are based on the anonymous
evaluations provided by the other members of the group. The final grade
awarded to group members will differ if their contributions are
evaluated differently.

\hypertarget{reading-guides}{%
\subsubsection{Reading Guides}\label{reading-guides}}

A set of graded questions is provided for each week's readings to steer
students towards the more important parts of the readings. Completed
reading guides serve as helpful study guides for the course quizzes and
help to identify areas towards which a student might need to focus more
research attention.

\hypertarget{discussion-grades}{%
\subsubsection{Discussion Grades}\label{discussion-grades}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each student will be assigned a list of questions, from which (s)he
  will choose one to answer in an initial \textbf{Discussion Post} to
  the discussion board. The Discussion Post should consist of a minimum
  of 300 words.
\item
  With a total of two (2) \textbf{Discussion Responses}, a student will
  respond to a discussion post offered by two (2) other students with at
  least 100 words.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\subsubsection{Final Project}\label{final-project}}

The Final Project will comprise the last two weeks of the semester. For
the project, students will be presented with a hypothetical political
scenario.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In \textbf{Part 1}, as a group, students submit a reference guide,
  along with peer evaluations of group members' contribution. The
  reference guide makes note of every legal topic/concept and case
  covered in the course implicated in the hypothetical scenario.
\item
  In \textbf{Part 2}, students submit indiviual, short essay responses
  to a set of questions.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{scales}{%
\subsection{Scales}\label{scales}}

This course uses the grading scale displayed here. Where they exist, due
dates should be strictly adhered to. Assignments will receive a
deduction of 5 percent for each calendar day they are late. Students are
expected to complete missing assignments before seeking any extra credit
(which is always offered to the entire class). Extra credit will not be
assigned within the last two weeks of the semester.

Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children
experience serious illness.

Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to ``\ldots be
honest and truthful and\ldots{} {[}to{]} strive for personal and
institutional integrity at Florida State University.'' (For more details
